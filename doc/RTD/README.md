SWIFT Documentation
===================

This is the main documentation for SWIFT that can be found on ReadTheDocs.

You will need the `sphinx` and `sphinx-autobuild` python packages (pip install
them!) to build the documentation to html, as well as the `sphinx_rtd_theme`
package which is used as the theme.

To build the documentation, `make html` and then it is available in
`build/html`.

Please consider adding documentation when you add code!
