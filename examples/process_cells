# Description:
#  Process all the cell dumps in the current directory.

#  Outputs file per rank with the active cells identified and marked as to
#  whether they are near an edge or not. Note requires the numbers of cells
#  per dimension of the space.
#
#  Also outputs a graphic showing the fraction of active cells on edges
#  for each step.

#  Handle command-line
