\subsection{Choice of time-step size}
\label{ssec:timesteps}

When running \swift with cosmological time-integration switched on, the
time-stepping algorithm gets modified in two ways. An additional criterion is
used to limit the maximal distance a particle can move and the integer time-line
used for the time-steps changes meaning and represents jumps in scale-factor $a$, 
hence requiring an additional conversion.

\subsubsection{Maximal displacement}

to prevent particles from moving on trajectories that do not include the effects
of the expansion of the Universe, we compute a maximal time-step for the
particles based on their RMS peculiar motion:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta t_{\rm cosmo} \equiv \mathcal{C}_{\rm RMS} \frac{a^2 d_{\rm p}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\rm p}}\sum_i | \mathbf{v}_i' |^2}},
  \label{eq:dt_RMS}
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all particles of a species $p$, $\mathcal{C}_{\rm RMS}$
is a free parameter, $N_{\rm p}$ is the number of baryonic or non-baryonic
particles, and $d_{\rm p}$ is the mean inter-particle separation for the
particle with the lowest mass $m_i$ of a given species:
\begin{equation}
  d_{\rm baryons} \equiv \left(\frac{m_i}{\Omega_{\rm b} \rho_{\rm crit}}\right)^{1/3}, \quad d_{\rm DM} \equiv \left(\frac{m_i}{\left(\Omega_{\rm m} - \Omega_{\rm b}\right) \rho_{\rm crit}}\right)^{1/3}.
  \nonumber
\end{equation}
We typically use $\mathcal{C}_{\rm RMS} = 0.25$ and given the slow evolution of
this maximal time-step size, we only re-compute it every time the tree is
reconstructed.

We also apply an additional criterion based on the smoothing scale of the forces
computed from the top-level mesh.  In eq.~\ref{eq:dt_RMS}, we replace
$d_{\rm p}$ by $a_{\rm smooth} \frac{L_{\rm box}}{N_{\rm mesh}}$, where we used
the definition of the mesh parameters introduced earlier. Given the rather
coarse mesh usually used in \swift, this time-step condition rarely dominates
the overall time-step size calculation.

\subsubsection{Conversion from time to integer time-line}
